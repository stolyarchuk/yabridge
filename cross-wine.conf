# Instead of specifying the target architecture below, we'll do this directly in
# the meson.build file. By setting the `-m64` flags there (or `-m32`), we can
# build both the regular 64-bit version of the host application and the 32-bit
# bit bridge in the same build. This ensures that the plugin and both host
# applications are always in sync. This might not be needed anymore once Meson
# cross compiling to multiple targets at once.
